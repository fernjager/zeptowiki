If your correct and full inet address is not provided inside
the registration mail => you should edit notifynewuser.sh (folder scripts)
and change the line wikiaddr='http://'${str%% *}':8000'
with wikiaddr='http://your_inet_address:8000'

CiWiki 1.7.0 alias DidiWiki  

IMPORTANT: 
- The file login.txt has moved in ~/didiwiki/permission. 
	Please, run the script finish_install.sh
- You need sSMTP to send emails
- Run ciwiki with the option -s ( didiwiki -s )
- Edit /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
- You need notifynewuser.sh in the folder ~/scripts/ 
- Read MAILINGCODE.

CiWiki 1.5.2 alias DidiWiki  

IMPORTANT: If you upgrade CiWiki from CiWiki 1.4.0 or under, please delete 
the file .login.txt in ~/.didiwiki folder. If you need to keep the login 
information, contact me. 

*** Version 1.5.1 & 1.5.2  ***

The Email is sent after each new registration (option -s); so it's not required 
to configure the crontab, but sSMTP is still required.

*** Version 1.5.0  ***

There is a login page; a 'new account page', a logoff and password change page.
The new file .login.txt in ~/.didiwiki folder is not compatible with the previous one.
This change was required to allow the password change.

The script notifynewuser.sh sends the access code by email, it requires sSMTP (a light 
MTP) and requires to configure the crontab too.

!!! Please delete .login.txt in ~/.didiwiki folder.  (If you want to keep it, 
there is a possibility to update it, contact me).

*** Version 1.2.1 and above ***

I added a simple login procedure to protect the privacy and to decrease the vandalism risk.
IT'S STILL EXPERIMENTAL. I tested CiWiki 1.2.1 on the intranet of my university, it seems 
working correctly, login and page permission work too, but I didn't have time to test all 
the possibilities, PLEASE, report any bugs or other issues. Thanks!

- It's based on the ip addresses of the open sessions.

- The login & permission routines are located in wikilogin. Two files are created:
.login.txt and .session.txt , both are located in /.didiwiki/ folder and are hidden.
.login.txt contains the username, its password (crypted), its email, ip address,
registration time (min), permission and validation flags. Currently, only the username 
and the password are used.
.session.txt contains the ip address of the user logged, the time of the last page 
opened and the username ( version 1.5.0 ).

- If after 30mn a page has not been opened then the ip is canceled, and the user will 
have to login again. This time can be changed in didi.h macro DISCONNECT

- The login requires the username and the password, both between 8 and 24 characters.
Space are not allowed, any other chars are theorically possible. (I have to change it).
The other fields (email,code) are only used to open an account.

- A new user will have to enter its username, password and email address. These info 
are stored in ~/newwikiusers.txt  , for example:
U:Gladiator P:Extrem125 M:inphilly@gmail.com I:127.0.0.1 T:21151948 C:43b002e6240
The user "Gladiator" will have to be contacted by email "inphilly@gmail.com" with 
these infos: username "Gladiator" password "Extrem125" and access code "43b002e6240"

A little script will be required to automatize the email with sendmail. (the script is 
provided with CiWiki 1.5.0 and above: notifynewuser.sh)

- The host computer (127.0.0.1) is always logged (CiWiki version < 1.5.0) or automatically
logged with the option -a (CiWiki version >= 1.5.1 )

- It's possible to have a list of unwanted ip address. Go in the folder ./didiwiki/permission 
and create a file .unwanted.txt (don't forget the dot to hide the file else that will not work) 
and write one line for each forbidden ip.

- passwords are crypted and stored in ./didiwiki/permission/.login.txt , crypting method 
can be modified, check eventually wikilogin.c.


LOGIN FEATURES:
***************
- Pages cannot be edited or deleted if the user is not logged.
- Page or part of the page can be hidden with the tag {{ private }}
- Weirdness: Pages can be created when the user is not logged but could 
not be modified (edited a second time). [probably, I will have to create this.]


Let me know your point of view!
