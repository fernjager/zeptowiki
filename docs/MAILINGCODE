AUTOMATIC MAILING OF THE ACCESS CODE

October 26, 2013:
-----------------

If your correct and full inet address is not provided inside
the registration mail => you should edit notifynewuser.sh (folder scripts)
and change the line wikiaddr='http://'${str%% *}':8000'
with wikiaddr='http://your_inet_address:8000'

The registration mail is not sent:
- Check is ssmtp is installed.
- ssmtp.conf is correctly configured? (sudo gedit /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf for example)
- revaliases is correctly configured? (sudo gedit /etc/ssmtp/revaliases for example)
- Check log files: cat /var/log/mail.err  cat /var/log/mail.log cat /var/log/mail.warn  cat /var/log/mail.info

Vers. 1.5.2 and above: 

The email has direct link that allows to validate the new account and to login immediatly. 

Vers. 1.5.1 and above:

 cron is not required. The script 'notifynewuser.sh' is launched 
after each new user registration. 'notifynewuser.sh' must be in the folder scripts/ 
located in your home directory ( ~/scripts/ ), and start didiwiki with the option -s 
  Ex. didiwiki -a -s
(don't forget to make 'notifynewuser.sh' executable).

Vers. 1.5.0:

It requires cron, sSMTP and notifynewuser.sh. You will have to edit manually 
the crontab and the configuration file of sSMTP.

newwikiuser.txt contains the username, password, email and access code
notifynewuser.sh is a small bash script that send the access code by email,
it uses sSMTP (a very light MTA which use your mailhost).

1 - Edit the crontab ( $ crontab -e )

In my case the script is located in /home/jp/Desktop/wiki/ciwiki-1.5.0/scripts 
and I want to run it every minute all the time ( * * * * * )
Example of crontab:

PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
SHELL=/bin/sh
# m h  dom mon dow   command
* * * * * /home/jp/Bureau/wiki/ciwiki-1.5.0/scripts/notifynewuser.sh&

(crontab is not required for CiWiki >= 1.5.1, see above)

2 - Install sSMTP and edit ssmtp.conf ( /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf )
Example of configuration for gmail:

root=
mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
hostname=inphilly@gmail.com
AuthUser=inphilly@gmail.com
AuthPass=**************
UseSTARTTLS=YES
FromLineOverride=NO
